# Abstract

This paper aims to introduce the semantics of two customization point objects, namely `execution::get_completion_timing` and `execution::get_completion_timing` for the current proposal for `std::execution` , P2300. These sender queries empower the sender to convey information about the completion behavior of its associated operation. This information proves instrumental in optimizing the behavior of algorithms, including but not limited to `sync_wait()`, `repeat()`-like algorithms or a scheduler-affine coroutine task type.

# Proposal

Let sender `sndr` and receiver `rcvr` be connected, let `env` be the receivers environment and `op` the resulting operation that is initiated by `execution::start(op)`. The following semantics are proposed.

## `execution::get_completion_timing`:

The query primarily addresses the timing of the completion-signal operation concerning the return from `execution::start(op)`. It specifies whether the completion-signal strongly happens before the return from `execution::start(op)` or if it occurs after the return of `execution::start(op)`. The result of this query gives no information about their location, i.e. the operation is allowed to be completed on a different thread than the one that initiated the operation.

### Possible Return Values

The return type of `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` is convertible to `execution::completion_timing`, which is an enumeration type with the following possible values:

```cpp
enum class completion_timing {
  early,
  delayed
};
```

**early:** When `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` returns `execution::completion_timing::early`, the connected receiver's completion-signal happens before the return from `execution::start()`.

**delayed:** Returning `execution::completion_timing::delayed` from `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` indicates that the return from `execution::start()` happens before the completion-signal operation.

If `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` is an invalid expression, the timing of the completion-signal operation is unknown and the return from `execution::start()` may happen before or after the completion-signal operation.

## `execution::get_completion_concurrency`:

This query is concerned with the concurrency of the completion operation itself.
It specifies whether the completion-signal operation is guaranteed to be executed sequentially with respect to other operations initiated by `execution::start()` (sequential) or if it can be executed concurrently, treating the completion and the return from `execution::start()` as if initiated by different threads (parallel).

### Possible Return Values

The return type of `execution::get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` is convertible to `execution::completion_concurrency`, which is an enumeration type with the following possible values:

```cpp
enum class completion_concurrency {
  sequential,
  parallel
};
```

**sequential:** When `execution::get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` is `execution::completion_concurrency::sequential`, the completion operation is guaranteed to be executed sequentially with respect to other operations that are initiated by `execution::start()`.

**parallel:** When `execution::get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` is `execution::completion_concurrency::parallel`, the completion-signal operation and the return from `execution::start()` are being executed as if they were initiated by different threads.

If `execution::get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` is an invalid expression, the it is unknown whether the completion-signal and the call to `execution::start()` are initiated by the same thread.

# Use Cases

The queries serve as a crucial determinant in understanding the behavior of asynchronous operations within different contexts. Its role extends across various functionalities and implementations.

## `sync_wait` algorithm

One possible implementation of `sync_wait` is to synchronize the completion of the async operation with a mutex and a condition variable.
But if `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` is `true`, the operation will be completed automatically when `execution::start(op)` returns thus no further signaling mechanism would be needed.
The sender query `execution::get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` can be used to determine whether thread synchronization really needs to be implemented.

## `repeat`-like algorithms
Consider a typical `repeat(sndr)` algorithm that repeats the resulting asynchronous operation.
If the operation completes early, the usual implementation results in a recursive call to `execuction::start()` within the completion signal `execution::set_value()` of an intermediate receiver. Therefore, some kind of prevention needs to be implemented to avoid recursive call stacks and stack overflow, e.g. using a lightweight scheduler.
On the other hand, if it is known at compile time whether the operation completes early or delayed the algorithm can be implemented such that the recursion is avoided in each case without the need to reschedule it on a scheduler.

## scheduler-affine task type
Consider a coroutine task type that ensures that each awaited expression completes on the initial scheduler. If a `co_await`'ed sender completes early, the task can be implemented such that the coroutine is resumed immediately. Otherwise the continuation need to be rescheduled on the current scheduler when the awaited expression completes.

# Implementation Experience

libunifex uses a `blocking(const Sender&) -> blocking_kind` query to provide this information for optimizations.
In contrast to the present proposal the values of `blocking_kind` include both dimensions of completion time and location in one single type, which are

- maybe: the completion behaviour is not known
- never: the receiver will never be called on the current thread before `start()` returns.
- always: the receiver is guaranteed to be called on some thread strongly-happens-before `start()` returns.
- always_inline: the receiver is guaranteed to be called inline on the current thread before `start()` returns.

# Why no `is_blocking` query?

An `is_blocking` query has been considered that indicates that the forward progress of the call to `execution::start(op)` may or may not depend on the forward progress of some other operation. A use-case might be an elastic thread pool that allocates additional execution resources to start blocking operations.

This author has decided against including this query here since there are some algorithms that cannot reliably propagate its value, such as `execution::then` or `execution::let_value`.

# Prior Work

The proposal P2257R0 pointed out that queries about the completion behaviour are properties of the associated operation. This is the reason why `get_completion_timing` and `get_completion_concurrency` additionally depend on the receivers environment, which is consistent with `get_completion_signatures`.

# Wording

## `execution::get_completion_timing`:

1. `get_completion_timing` primarily addresses the timing of the completion-signal operation concerning the return from `execution::start`. It specifies whether the completion-signal strongly happens before the return from `execution::start`.

2. The name `get_completion_timing` denotes a query object template. For some subexpression `q`, let `Q` be `decltype((q))`. If the template argument `Tag` in `get_completion_timing<Tag>(q)` is not one of set_value_t, set_error_t, or set_stopped_t, `get_completion_timing<Tag>(q)` is ill-formed. Otherwise, `get_completion_timing<Tag>(q)` is expression-equivalent to `mandate-nothrow-call(tag_invoke, get_completion_timing, as_const(q))` if this expression is well-formed. 
- Mandates: The type of the expression above is convertible to `std::execution::completion_timing`.

1. The expression `forwarding_query(get_completion_timing<Tag>)` has value `true`. -->

# Implementation experience

- `just`:
  - `get_completion_timing()`: `always`
  - `get_completion_concurrency()`: `sequential`


- `then(s, fn)`:
  - `get_completion_timing(env)`: `get_completion_timing(s, env)`
  - `get_completion_concurrency(env)`: `get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` -->
