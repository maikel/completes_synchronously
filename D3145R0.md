# Abstract

This paper aims to introduce the semantics of the customization point object `execution::completes_inline` for the current proposal of `std::execution` , P2300. This sender query empowers the sender to convey information about the completion behavior of its associated operation. This information proves instrumental in optimizing the behavior of algorithms, including but not limited to `sync_wait()`, `repeat()`-like algorithms or a scheduler-affine coroutine task type.

# Proposal

Let sender `sndr` and receiver `rcvr` be connected, let `env` be the receivers environment and `op` the resulting operation that is initiated by `execution::start(op)`. The following semantics are proposed.

## `execution::completes_inline`

The query addresses whether the connected receiver's completion-signal operation occurs on the calling thread of `execution::start(op)` before it returns. 

### Possible Return Values

The return type of `execution::completes_inline(sndr, env)` is convertible to `execution::inline_guarantee`, which is an enumeration type with the following possible values:

```cpp
enum class inline_guarantee {
  never,
  always
};
```
**always:** A connected receiver's completion-signal operations occur on the calling thread before `execution::start()` returns.

**never:** A connected receiver's completion-signal operations will not occur on the calling thread before `execution::start()` returns.

If `execution::completes_inline(sndr, env)` is an invalid expression, the timing of the completion-signal operation is unknown and the return from `execution::start()` may happen before or after the completion-signal operation.

Senders that complete inline automatically retain the previous completion scheduler.

## `execution::completes_synchronously

The query primarily addresses the timing of the completion-signal operation concerning the return from `execution::start(op)`. It specifies whether the completion-signal strongly happens before the return from `execution::start(op)` or if it occurs after the return of `execution::start(op)`. Even if the 

### Possible Return Values

The return type of `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` is convertible to `execution::completion_timing`, which is an enumeration type with the following possible values:

```cpp
enum class completion_timing {
  early,
  delayed
};
```

**early:** When `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` returns `execution::completion_timing::early`, the connected receiver's completion-signal happens before the return from `execution::start()`.

**delayed:** Returning `execution::completion_timing::delayed` from `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` indicates that the return from `execution::start()` happens before the completion-signal operation.

If `execution::get_completion_timing(sndr, env)` is an invalid expression, the timing of the completion-signal operation is unknown and the return from `execution::start()` may happen before or after the completion-signal operation.

# Use Cases

The query serves as a crucial determinant in understanding the behavior of asynchronous operations within different contexts. Its role extends across various functionalities and implementations.

## `sync_wait` algorithm

One possible implementation of `sync_wait` is to synchronize the completion of the async operation with a mutex and a condition variable.
If `execution::completes_inline(sndr, env)` is `inline_guarantee::always`, the operation will be completed automatically when `execution::start(op)` returns thus no further signaling mechanism nor synchronization is needed.
<!-- The sender query `execution::get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` can be used to determine whether thread synchronization really needs to be implemented. -->

## `repeat`-like algorithms
Consider a typical `repeat(sndr)` algorithm that repeats the resulting asynchronous operation.
If it is not known whether the child operation completes synchronously or asynchronously, some kind of prevention needs to be implemented to avoid recursive call stacks and a resulting stack overflow, e.g. a lightweight scheduler to periodically reschedule the repeating operation.
On the other hand, if it is known at compile time whether the operation completes with `inline_guarantee::always` or `inline_guarantee::never` the algorithm can be implemented such that the recursion is avoided.

# Implementation Experience

libunifex uses a `blocking(const Sender&) -> blocking_kind` query to provide this information for optimizations.
The values of `blocking_kind` are

- maybe: the completion behaviour is not known
- never: the receiver will never be called on the current thread before `start()` returns.
- always: the receiver is guaranteed to be called on some thread strongly-happens-before `start()` returns.
- always_inline: the receiver is guaranteed to be called inline on the current thread before `start()` returns.

<!-- # Why no `is_blocking` query?

An `is_blocking` query has been considered that indicates that the forward progress of the call to `execution::start(op)` may or may not depend on the forward progress of some other operation. A use-case might be an elastic thread pool that allocates additional execution resources to start blocking operations.

This author has decided against including this query here since there are some algorithms that cannot reliably propagate its value, such as `execution::then` or `execution::let_value`. -->

# Prior Work

The proposal P2257R0 pointed out that queries about the completion behaviour are properties of the associated operation. This is the reason why `inline_guarantee` additionally depend on the receivers environment, which is analogous to `get_completion_signatures`.

# Wording

## `execution::get_inline_guarantee`:

1. `get_inline_guarantee` primarily addresses the timing of the completion-signal operation concerning the return from `execution::start`. It specifies whether the completion-signal strongly happens before the return from `execution::start`.

2. The name `get_inline_guarantee` denotes a query object template. For some subexpression `q`, let `Q` be `decltype((q))`. If the template argument `Tag` in `get_inline_guarantee<Tag>(q)` is not one of set_value_t, set_error_t, or set_stopped_t, `get_inline_guarantee<Tag>(q)` is ill-formed. Otherwise, `get_inline_guarantee<Tag>(q)` is expression-equivalent to `mandate-nothrow-call(tag_invoke, get_inline_guarantee, as_const(q))` if this expression is well-formed. 
- Mandates: The type of the expression above is convertible to `std::execution::inline_guarantee`.

1. The expression `forwarding_query(get_inline_guarantee<Tag>)` has value `true`. -->

# Implementation experience

- `just`:
  - `get_inline_guarantee()`: `always`
  - `get_completion_concurrency()`: `sequential`


- `then(s, fn)`:
  - `get_inline_guarantee(env)`: `get_inline_guarantee(s, env)`
  - `get_completion_concurrency(env)`: `get_completion_concurrency(sndr, env)` -->
