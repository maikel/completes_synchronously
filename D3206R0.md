# Abstract

This paper continues [@P2257R0] and proposes two sender queries for [@P2300R7], namely `execution::completes_inline` and `execution::starts_blockingly`. These sender queries empower a sender to convey additional information about the starting and completion behavior of its associated operation that is unavailable today.

This proposal does not change any sender concepts. Providing support for those queries is optional for authors of senders.

# Motivation

The information on whether a resulting operation completes inline proves instrumental in optimizing the behavior of algorithms, including but not limited to `sync_wait()` and `repeat()`-like algorithms or a scheduler-affine coroutine task type. The sender query `starts_blockingly` ensures the correctness of algorithms in situations where a non-blocking behavior is required.

## `sync_wait` algorithm

One possible implementation of `sync_wait` is to synchronize the completion of the async operation with some signaling mechanism.
If `completes_inline(sender, sync-wait-env)` returns true, the operation completes before the call to `execution::start(op)` returns. 
Thus, no further signaling mechanism is needed.

## `repeat`-like algorithms

Consider a typical `repeat(sender)` algorithm that repeats the construction and start of the resulting child operation.
If the child operation completes inline the `repeat()` algorithm can be implemented as a while loop. If `completes_inline(sender, env)` returns false the child operation calls its completion signal either in a different thread of execution or after the call to `start()` returns. 
If it is not known whether an operation completes inline or not, one needs to mitigate a possible recursive call to `start()` by e.g. rescheduling on a lightweight scheduler.

## scheduler-affine task type

Consider a scheduler-affine coroutine task type that ensures for each awaited expression that it completes on the current scheduler. If an awaited sender operation completes inline, the task can be optimized by resuming eagerly. 

## A `run` algorithm to compose multiple `run_loop`-like contexts

Consider the following example, which defines a concept for a driveable execution context

```cpp
template <class Context>
concept driveable_context = requires (Context& context) {
  { context.when_ready() } -> sender;
  { context.run_some() } -> sender;
};
```

To make an algorithm that composes multiple such contexts, it could be helpful to know whether 

1. the sender returned from `when_ready()` starts blockingly
2. the sender returned from `run_some()` completes inline

There is some design space regarding a composition.
For the first bullet point, one might either require `when_ready()` to be a non-blocking operation or schedule its execution on an extra execution resource if it is.
Regarding the second bullet point, one might require `context.run_some()` to return a sender that completes inline.

# Proposal

Let sender `sndr` and receiver `rcvr` be connected, let `env` be the receiver environment and `op` the resulting operation that is initiated by `execution::start(op)`. The customization point objects `execution::completes_inline(sndr, env)` and `execution::starts_blockingly(sndr, env)` are proposed.

Similar to `get_completion_signatures(sndr, env)`, instead of providing member functions
```cpp
struct my_sender {
  // ...
  auto completes_inline(auto&&) const noexcept -> std::true_type;
};
```
senders are allowed to provide using-declarations `completes_inline` or `starts_blockingly` if those values are independent of the receivers environment. E. g.
```cpp
struct my_sender {
  // ...
  using completes_inline = std::true_type;
};
```

## `execution::completes_inline`

The return type of `completes_inline(sndr, env)` is convertible to `bool`.

**true:** A connected receiver's completion-signal operations will occur on the calling thread before `execution::start()` returns.

**false:** A connected receiver's completion-signal operations will not occur on the calling thread before `execution::start()` returns

If `completes_inline(sndr, env)` is an invalid expression no guarantee will be made.

## `execution::starts_blockingly`

This query describes whether a call to `start()` blocks the calling thread as defined in **[defns.block]**.
The return type of `starts_blockingly(sndr, env)` is convertible to `bool`.

**true:** execution of `execution::start()` shall block pending on some condition external to the steps of the thread of execution.

**false:** execution of `execution::start()` shall not block pending any condition external to the steps of the thread of execution.

If `starts_blockingly(sndr, env)` is an invalid expression no guarantee will be made.

Note: This is different from how [@P0443R14] described the blocking property.

# Implementation Experience

libunifex uses a `blocking(const Sender&) -> blocking_kind` query to provide this information for optimizations, which is very similar to `completes_inline`.

- maybe: the completion behaviour is not known
- never: the receiver will never be called on the current thread before `start()` returns.
- always: the receiver is guaranteed to be called on some thread strongly-happens-before `start()` returns.
- always_inline: the receiver is guaranteed to be called inline on the current thread before `start()` returns.

# Prior Work

The proposal [@P2257R0] pointed out that queries about the completion behavior are properties of the associated operation. This is the reason why this papers makes the queries depend on the receiver's environment, analogous to `get_completion_signatures(sndr, env)`.

# Open Questions

This paper does not address the question of whether an async operation as a whole makes forward progress concerning provided forward progress guarantees.

Also, `starts_blockingly` provides information on only one-half of the operation. Another question to be asked could be whether the completion function of a receiver will block. This would be a regular query on a receiver's environment.

Furthermore, it is an open question whether the queries should be part of the sender's attributes instead of being direct member functions of the respective sender types.

# Implications on Sender Factories and Adaptors

The following section describes how to compute the values for `completes_inline` and `starts_blockingly` for each sender algorithm in [@P2300R7] for its default implementation. Domain specializations are allowed to change those values.

## Sender Factories

In general, each sender factory needs to provide the information from its respective implementation.

### schedule(run_loop::scheduler)

- `completes_inline`: `std::false_type`
- `starts_blockingly`: `std::false_type`

### just(), just_error(), just_stopped()

- `completes_inline`: `std::true_type`
- `starts_blockingly`: `std::false_type`

### read()

- `completes_inline`: `std::true_type`

Note: Starting a `read` operation invokes a call to `tag(env)` and we don't require this to be non-blocking.

## Sender Adaptors

### `finally(sender1, sender2)`, `transfer(sender, scheduler)`, `on(scheduler, sender)`

Let `s` denote the expression `finally(sender1, sender2)`

- `completes_inline(s, env)`:
  - true, if `completes_inline(sender1, env)` and `completes_inline(sender2, env)` are true
  - false, if `completes_inline(sender1, env)` or `completes_inline(sender2, env)` are false

- `starts_blockingly(s, env)`:
  - true, if `starts_blockingly(sender1, env)` or `(completes_inline(sender1, env) && starts_blockingly(sender2, env))` are true
  - false, if `(starts_blockingly(sender1, env) ` and `completes_inline(sender1, env)` are false

### `then(sender, fn)`, `upon_error(sender, fn)`, `upon_stopped(sender, fn)`

Let `s` denote the expression `then(sender, fn)`

- `completes_inline(s, env)` returns `completes_inline(sender, env)`

- `starts_blockingly(s, env)`
  - true, if `starts_blockingly(sender, env)` is true
  - false, if `starts_blockingly(sender, env)` is false and `completes_inline(sender, env)` is false 

Note: we cannot know whether a call to `fn` will be blocking

### `let_value(sender, fn)`, `let_error(sender, fn)`, `let_stopped(sender, fn)`

Let `s` denote the expression `let_value(sender, fn)`.
Let `rs...` denote the set of all possible result-senders returned from `fn`.

- `completes_inline(s, env)`
  - true, if `completes_inline(sender, env)` returns true and `(completes_inline(rs, env) && ...)` is true
  - false, if `completes_inline(sender, env)` is false or if `(completes_inline(rs, env) || ...)` is false
  - not known if `completes_inline(rs, env)` is not known for any sender of the pack

- `starts_blockingly(s, env)`
  - true, if `starts_blockingly(sender, env)` is true
  - false, if `starts_blockingly(sender, env)` is false and `!completes_inline(sender, env) or ` is false 

### `into_variant(sender)`, `stopped_as_optional(sender)`

Let `s` denote the expression `into_variant(sender, fn)`.
- `completes_inline(s, env)` returns `completes_inline(sender, env)`
- `starts_blockingly(s, env)` returns `starts_blockingly(sender, env)`

### `bulk(input, shape, fn)`

TBD, implementation-defined?

### `when_all(senders...)`

Let `s` denote the expression `when_all(senders...)`
let `last` denote the last element of the pack `senders...`

- `completes_inline(s, env)`
  - true, if `(completes_inline(senders, env) && ...)` is true
  - false, if the `completes_inline(last, env)` is false

- `starts_blockingly(s, env)`
  - true, if `(completes_inline(senders, env) || ...)` is true
  - false, if `!(completes_inline(senders, env) || ...)` is false
  - not known if it is not known for any sndr of the pack

### `split()`

TBD, I think it returns dynamic values
